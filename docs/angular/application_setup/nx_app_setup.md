# NX Application Setup

Nx is a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos. It is designed to help you efficiently manage large-scale,
enterprise-level projects by providing a suite of development tools and best practices.

## Key features of Nx

- **Monorepo Management**: Nx allows you to manage multiple projects (e.g., Angular applications, libraries, and backend
  services) in a single repository. This approach helps in sharing code, configurations, and dependencies across
  projects, making it easier to maintain consistency and coherence.
- **Code Generation**: Nx provides powerful code generation capabilities. It can generate components, services, modules,
  and more, helping to maintain consistent coding patterns and reducing manual coding effort.
- **Dependency Graph**: Nx analyzes your codebase to create a dependency graph. This graph helps you understand how
  different parts of your codebase are connected and can be useful for tasks like optimizing build times and identifying
  circular dependencies.
- **Built-in Architectural Best Practices**: Nx encourages best practices for software architecture, including concepts
  like feature modules, smart and dumb components, and domain-driven design.
- **Support for Multiple Frameworks**: While Nx is known for its strong support for Angular, it is not limited to just
  Angular. It can be used with other frameworks and libraries, such as React, Node.js, and more.
- **Efficient Build and Test Processes**: Nx provides mechanisms for efficient building and testing of your projects. It
  can automatically figure out which projects have changed and only rebuild and test those, saving time during
  development.
- **Plugins and Extensibility**: Nx is highly extensible. You can create custom plugins to extend its functionality or
  use existing community-contributed plugins.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Nx provides tooling and best practices for setting up continuous
  integration and deployment pipelines, helping you automate the process of deploying your applications.

## How to set up an Angular Application using NX?

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myngapp --preset=angular-standalone
```

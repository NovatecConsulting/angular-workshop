## Basic


## Intermediate

An intermediate Angular developer is proficient in creating services, making HTTP requests, and managing component
state. They are comfortable with concepts like dependency injection, observables, and routing. They can build
interactive web applications and handle more complex data scenarios.

### Services and Dependency Injection:

> Create a service to manage data (e.g., a user service).
> Inject this service into multiple components and demonstrate data sharing.

### HTTP Requests and Observables

> Integrate Angular's HttpClient module to fetch data from an external API.
> Display the retrieved data in a component using Observables.

### State Management (NgRx)

> Implement basic state management using NgRx.
> Create a simple store, define actions, and demonstrate how components can interact with the store.

## Advanced

An advanced Angular developer has expertise in advanced features like lazy loading modules, implementing complex routing
with guards, and employing state management libraries like NgRx. They are skilled in optimizing performance and
architecting large-scale applications. They can tackle complex application requirements with efficiency and
effectiveness.

### Lazy Loading Modules

> Implement lazy loading for a feature module in a large-scale Angular application.
> Optimize the application's performance by loading modules on-demand.

### Advanced Routing and Guards

> Implement route guards to secure certain routes in the application.
> Create an authentication guard that restricts access to authenticated users only.

### Advanced Component Communication

> Implement a complex parent-child component interaction scenario using techniques like `<ng-content>` and ViewChild.
> Demonstrate effective communication patterns between components.

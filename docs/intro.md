# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Let's discover **Angular in depth**.

## Getting Started

For the full Setup Guide see [Setup Chapter](/docs/setup).

### Cloud IDE

Since most exercises can be solved using the latest version of Chrome / Edge / Safari, it is not mandatory to have any local IDE.

> Ensure you can access [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) and you can see an example project after clicking the
> Angular icon.

### Local Development

Get started by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This can be done by utilizing Node Version
Manager (`nvm` see [github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

> HINT: The all tasks where tested for `â¬¢ v18.16.0`

The installation process can defer depending on your OS.

To verify the installation run `node --version`.

```bash
# angular-workshop is ðŸ“¦ v0.1.0 via â¬¢ v18.16.0 
node --version
# RESPONSE: v18.16.0
```

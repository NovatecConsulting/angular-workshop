# Single Page Application (SPA)

## What is an SPA?

SPA stands for Single Page Application.
It is a web application that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience similar
to a desktop application. The page doesn't reload when the user interacts
with it, instead, it dynamically updates the content on the page using JavaScript [1].

### Advantages and disadvantages of the SPA

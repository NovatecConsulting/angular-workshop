# Getting Started

For the hands-on part of this course, we are using on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com), so you can do this course
just by using the browser.
If you like to work offline, it is best to install a local development environment.

Only some advanced testing or debugging chapters cant be followed without a local installation

## Local Development Environment

Since your developer desktop operating system may vary,
we only present the requirements here and not the options for installing these tools.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything
from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It can be installed following the official guide: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to use the node package manager (npm) _(see related
prerequisites [chapter NPM](prerequisites/package-managers#node-package-manager-npm))_

It can be installed following the official guide: https://nodejs.org/en/download

:::tip

In case you have to switch node.js versions frequently, you can use tools like node version
manager ([check `nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).)

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Since people are different, the IDE also varies.
Therefore, we present a list of possible IDEs, and it's up to your taste which one to choose.
